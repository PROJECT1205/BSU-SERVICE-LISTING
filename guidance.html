               <h2>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp GUIDANCE OFFICE  <br> <br>The Guidance Office is a vital resource on campus, dedicated to providing support, guidance, and accountability to <br>
            students as they navigate their academic journey. While our primary focus is on offering assistance and mentorship, we <br>
            also play a role in upholding the standards and values of our university community.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supportive Guidance: Whether you're facing personal challenges, academic struggles, or simply seeking guidance on your
                    educational path, our doors are always open to lend a listening ear and offer compassionate support. Our trained
                    counselors are here to help you explore solutions, develop coping strategies, and navigate the complexities of
                    university life.
                    </li>
                    <li>Accountability and Discipline: As members of the university community, we all have a responsibility to uphold its values
                    and standards of conduct. In instances where a student's behavior or actions may have fallen short of these
                    expectations, the Guidance Office plays a role in addressing the situation with fairness and accountability. This may
                    involve discussions, warnings, or disciplinary measures as necessary to maintain the integrity of our community and
                    promote a safe and respectful environment for all.</li>
                    <li>Conflict Resolution: When conflicts arise between students, faculty, or staff members, the Guidance Office serves as a
                    neutral mediator to facilitate communication, resolve misunderstandings, and seek amicable solutions. Our goal is to
                    foster constructive dialogue and promote mutual understanding, ultimately fostering a harmonious and inclusive campus
                    environment.</li>
                    <li> Education and Prevention: In addition to addressing issues as they arise, the Guidance Office is committed to proactive
                    efforts aimed at education and prevention. Through workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, we strive to promote
                    positive behaviors, enhance interpersonal skills, and empower students to make informed decisions that contribute to
                    their personal and academic success.</li>
