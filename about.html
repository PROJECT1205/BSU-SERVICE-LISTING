            <h2>A campus service listing website is an online platform that provides information about various services available on a <br>
            college or university campus. These resources include department buildings, dining areas, health clinics, and student <br>
            support services. This website includes a directory or list that makes it easy for students to locate and use <br>
            information about various campus services, such as directions to that facility, hours of operation, and any other <br>
            relevant information. According to Razaeean et al., (2012) as cited in a study by Deventer & Lues (2022), the perceived <br>
            usefulness, usability, and website innovation of a university website positively influences the students’ satisfaction <br>
            with the website. Therefore, in the context of creating a campus service listing website specifically tailored for <br>
            freshmen navigation, our research will prioritize the consideration of these factors. The website will be created with <br>
            the intention of making it as useful as possible for first-year students by providing a comprehensive listing of campus <br>
            resources relevant to their needs. A major focus will be usability, with features like user-friendly interface, clear <br>
            organization, and simple navigation designed to make it easier for the students to use. Additionally, a focus on website <br>
            innovation will be done to provide fresh features and capabilities that appeal to the first-year students and improve <br>
            their navigation of campus services.</h2>
